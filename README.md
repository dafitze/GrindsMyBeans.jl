# GrindsMyBeans.jl

Julia project to estimate grind settings for the perfect extraction of espresso. By perfect extration we mean 25s extraction time for 40g of coffee. The grind settings are estimated based on coffee machine, coffee, grinder, weather.

An implementation of this project in R can be found [here](https://github.com/StefanThoma/GrindsMyBeans).
